<h1>Artificial Intelligence in the Finance Sector</h1>
<br>
<p>The necessity for efficient processing and understanding of patterns in bulk data has lead to growing demands for implementation of AI in the finance sector. Relative to those performed by humans, AI-driven processes are often a faster, more effective means of identifying data patterns and making appropriate, logical decisions.</p>

<h3>Risk Assessment</h3> 

<p>Learning from past data trends is a central facet of AI and machine learning. In the context of the finance industry, the credit card approval process poses an opportunity for useful application of AI technology. Data such as that concerning individuals&#39; loan repayment habits, number of currently active loans, number of existing credit cards, etc. can be used to gauge whether one is a suitable, qualified candidate for a credit card at a particular financial institution. 
</p>

<p>The role of the human analyst is quickly being replaced by AI, which, as it learns over time, is less prone to inaccuracies and is capable of analyzing vast quantities of data. Depending on individuals&#39; risk appetite, for example, AI-driven systems can suggest possible portfolio solutions and perform trades that best align with a client&#39;s risk tolerance.
</p>

<br>


<h3>Fraud Detection and Security</h3> 

<p>AI can be used to track past spending behaviors, pointing out unusual spending patterns or suspicious transactions; for example, detecting credit card spending in different countries or ATM withdrawals for sums unusual for the account in question. If AI technology incorrectly raises a red flag for a regular transaction, manual correction by a human will ultimately serve to improve future accuracy of the system; the machine learns from past experiences, thus gaining a better understanding of what can and cannot be considered fraudulent activity.
</p>

<br>

<h3>Algorithmic Trading</h3> 

<p>Utilizing past data trends, investment firms can make use of AI technology to predict future patterns in the market and buy/sell accordingly. Unlike the human analyst, AI is capable of manipulating and analyzing large volumes of data quickly and accurately. Regarding potential anomalies in data trends (e.g. the 2008 financial crisis), AI can be utilized to identify possible triggers and account for them in future forecasting.
</p>

<p>Further, algorithmic trading methods can be used to make fast, automated trading decisions and engage in high-frequency trading whereby thousands or millions of trades occur daily.
</p>

<br>

<h3>Portfolio Management and Financial Advisory</h3> 

<p>Robo-advisory involves using a combination of machine calculations and human insight to calibrate a financial portfolio specific to the goals and risk tolerance of an individual investor. Criteria such as age, income, and current financial assets are used to allocate investments in accordance with the individual&#39;s goals and real-time fluctuations in the market. In addition to being an efficient means of portfolio management, robo-advisory lessens the burden currently placed on financial institutions, as managing individual, smaller investments remains cost-effective.
